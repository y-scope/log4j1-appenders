/**
 * Base class for Log4j file appenders with specific design characteristics;
 * namely, the appenders:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Buffer logs, e.g. for streaming compression.</li>
 *   <li>Rollover log files based on some policy, e.g. exceeding a threshold
 *   size.</li>
 *   <li>Flush and synchronize log files (e.g. to remote storage) based on how
 *   fresh they are.</li>
 * </ol>
 * For instance, such an appender might compress log events as they are
 * generated, while still flushing and uploading them to remote storage a few
 * seconds after an error log event.
 * <p>
 * This class handles keeping track of how fresh the logs are and the high-level
 * logic to trigger flushing, syncing, and rollover at the appropriate times.
 * Derived classes must implement methods to do the actual flushing, syncing,
 * and rollover as well as indicate whether rollover is necessary.
 * <p>
 * The freshness property maintained by this class allows users to specify the
 * delay between a log event being generated and the log file being flushed and
 * synchronized. There are two types of delays that can be specified, and each
 * can be specified per log level:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>hard timeouts</b> - these timeouts cause a hard deadline to be set
 *   for when flushing must occur. E.g., if log event occurs at time t, then a
 *   hard deadline is set at time (t + hardTimeout). This hard deadline may be
 *   decreased if a subsequent log event has an associated hard timeout that
 *   would result in an earlier hard deadline.</li>
 *   <li><b>soft timeouts</b> - these timeouts cause a soft deadline to be set
 *   for when flushing should occur. Unlike the hard deadline, this deadline may
 *   be increased if a subsequent log event occurs before any deadline is
 *   reached. Note however, that the timeout used to calculate the soft deadline
 *   is set to the minimum of the timeouts associated with the log events that
 *   have occurred before the deadline. E.g., if a log event associated with a
 *   5s soft timeout occurs, and then is followed by a log event associated with
 *   a 10s soft timeout, the soft deadline will be set as if the second log
 *   event had a had 5s soft timeout.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Once a deadline is reached, the current timeouts and deadlines are reset.
 * <p>
 * For example, let's assume the soft and hard timeouts for ERROR logs are set
 * to 5 seconds and 5 minutes respectively. Now imagine an ERROR log event is
 * generated at t = 0s. This class will trigger a flush at t = 5s unless another
 * ERROR log event is generated before then. If one is generated at t = 4s, then
 * this class will omit the flush at t = 5s and trigger a flush at t = 9s. If
 * ERROR log events keep being generated before a flush occurs, then this class
 * will definitely trigger a flush at t = 5min based on the hard timeout.
 * <p>
 * Maintaining these timeouts per log level allows us to flush logs sooner if
 * more important log levels occur. For instance, we can set smaller timeouts
 * for ERROR log events compared to DEBUG log events.
 * <p>
 * This class also allows logs to be collected while the JVM is shutting down.
 * This can be enabled by setting closeOnShutdown to false. When the JVM starts
 * shutting down, the appender will maintain two timeouts before the shutdown
 * is allowed to complete:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>soft timeout</b> - this is a relative delay from when the shutdown
 *   is requested to when the shutdown is allowed to continue. It is soft in the
 *   sense that if a log event occurs before this delay expires, the delay is
 *   reset based on the current time.</li>
 *   <li><b>hard timeout</b> - this is a relative delay from when the shutdown
 *   is requested to when the shutdown is allowed to continue.</li>
 * </ul>
